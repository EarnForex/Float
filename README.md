# Float

Float is a free custom indicator for MT4 and MT5 coded by EarnForex.com. It was originally developed by Barry Stander. It detects major trend waves on a given number of bars and draws Fibonacci and DiNapoli levels across them.

This indicator uses tick volume to analyze trends. You must be aware that tick volume is a rather controversial tool in spot Forex trading.
